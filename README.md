## 📊 CPI Inflation Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project models inflation rates for various products over time using exponential and polynomial regression models. It analyzes inflation growth and compares product inflation rates. The project uses Python and data analysis tools to understand and forecast inflation trends.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Source: U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI prices of products from 1900 to 2015)  
- Data Size: **177 rows × 38 columns** (53.6 KB)  

## 🏗️ Methods & Models
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
Models Used: Exponential Regression, Polynomial Regression
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy

## 🔍 Key Findings

Exponential models successfully identified inflation patterns for products.
Polynomial regression provided additional insights into product-specific inflation trends.
Inflation rates showed significant variation between product categories.
